# Pluralsight Planner

Chrome Extension that will help you take full control of your
learning with Pluralsight.

<!-- TODO: link to demo -->
<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

## Problem

We are aware there are features like "Bookmarks" and "Playlists"
available in Pluralsight. However they offer the most basic experience
and are hardly useful for power-users.

For too many years we've been using some unfit external software
to track our progress and planning what to learn next. It's time
to create a tool to make us spend **less time on planning and
tracking** and give us more time to spend on learning.

### Target audience

[Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) users who learn like crazy
and plan future courses.

## Features

We are working to set up skeleton of the project.
Stay tuned for demo.
