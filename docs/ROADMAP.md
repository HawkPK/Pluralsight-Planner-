# Roadmap

## Core Requirements

Extension will make it easy to create powerful playlists that will help you
manage interesting courses through tags, categories, paths.

As creators of this product, we would like to start with proposing better
way of organizing Pluralsight courses. Our playlist is more complex concept
than what Pluralsight has to offer right now. For users that have a long list
of courses they wish to watch in the near future, we are going to prepare
tagging, custom subcategories, offline-first experience, new courses suggestions
and real playlist duration forecasting.

## Progress

We use GitLab [milestones](https://gitlab.com/jsek/pluralsight-planner/milestones?state=all)
view to track progress.
